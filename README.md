In daily life, users are integrating wearable technology products into their lives
more and more day by day. This technological revolution, which started with the daily
use of smart phones, continues to accelerate in the market with products such as smart
watches and smart wristbands. Smart glasses, which are new types of wearable
technology products that include augmented reality in the past years, have not received
a great acceptance in the market yet. The reason why these wearable technology
products, which bring the border between reality and information technologies closer
together, have not yet found a place in the market, is that smart glasses and their
derivatives are not attractive to users in terms of their design and their costs are
relatively high. For this reason, the project was made on the design of an external smart
glasses apparatus with a lower cost and where the users can change the onboard
software according to their needs and their desired functionality

Development board used in the Bluetooth Based External Smart Glass Apparatus is ESP32-WROOM-32D. Development environment is Platform.IO and operating system is FreeRTOS.
